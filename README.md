# 2-D reactive flow solver
# Test
# Now need to work on the kinetics of 1-step reaction rate calculation

1 reaction rate calculation
- 1-step kinetics
- detailed kinetics
! here
! work on this section
! autoignition process

based on Cantera
- species: index k
- reactions: index l

2 convection flux calculation

- reconstruction

3 diffusion flux calculation

- based on Cantera
